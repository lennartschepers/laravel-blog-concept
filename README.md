# laravel-blog-concept
Simple blog concept with features such as:
* authentication 
  * registering
  * logging in
* posts with images
* sorting by category and / or search query
* commenting
* pagination
* factories for easy debugging

Styling done with tailwindcss and inline javascript is provided by alpineJS.
The database is mysql

## todo
To expand this concept I would like to add pages such as a;
* Dashboard page where users can manage their posts and edit / delete them
* Newsletter subscription api integration (currently the subscription box is a blank field)
